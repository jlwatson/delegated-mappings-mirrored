                    Delegated Authenticated Mappings
                      draft-watson-dinrg-delmap-00

Abstract

   Authoritative mappings are commonplace (DNS resolution, TLS
   certificates, etc.) but centrally served and lack a common interface.
   This draft specifies a generalized scheme for authenticating mappings
   with a structure that explicitly supports delegation.  The resulting
   data is secured through any general purpose distributed consensus
   protocol; clients may query the local state of any number of
   participants and receive the correct result barring a compromise of
   the consensus layer.

1.  Introduction

   Internet applications rely heavily on authoritative translation to
   function correctly.  Typical services might resolve domain mappings
   using DNS [RFC1034], verify the validity of X.509 certificates
   [RFC6960], or send encrypted email [RFC4880], among others.  Serving
   incorrect and/or malicious mappings can easily compromise
   infrastructure security, thus prompting efforts to secure these
   mechanisms: Certificate Transparency (CT) [RFC6962] for misissued
   certificates, DNSSEC [RFC4033], and binary transparency for
   verifiable executables [bin-transparency].

   Presented in this draft is a generalized mechanism for authenticating
   and managing such mappings.  Specifically, we describe the structure
   for a distributed directory with explicit support for delegation.
   Certain known entities are assigned namespaces, loosely associated
   with a service provided by that entity (i.e domain prefixes for DNS
   Authorities).  Under that namespace, are authorized to create mapping
   records, or _cells_, a unit of ownership in the service.  A
   namespace's cells are grouped into a logical unit we term a _table_.

   Table cells may also explicitly document the delegation of a portion
   of the authority's namespace to another entity with a given public
   key, along with a guarantee on that delegation's lifetime.  Each
   delegation forms a new table, for which the delegee is the sole

   authority.  Thus, the delegating entity may not make modifications to
   a delegated table and need not be trusted by the delegee.  The
   namespace segment may be further delegated to others.

   The delegation trees maintain security and consistency through a
   distributed consensus algorithm.  When a participant receives an
   update, they verify and submit it to the consensus layer, after
   which, if successful, the change is applied to its associated table.
   Clients may query any number of trusted servers and expect the result
   to be correct barring widespread collusion.

   The risk of successful attacks on this system vary based on the
   consensus scheme used.  Detailed descriptions of specific protocol
   implementations are out of scope for this draft, but at a minimum,
   the consensus algorithm must apply mapping updates in a consistent
   order, prevent equivocation or unauthorized modification, and enforce
   the semantic rules associated with each table.  We find that
   federated protocols such as the Stellar Consensus Protocol
   [I-D.mazieres-dinrg-scp] are promising given their capability for
   open participation, broad diversity of interests among consensus
   participants, and a measure of accountability for submitting
   deceptive updates.

   This document specifies the structure for authenticated mapping
   management and its interface with a consensus protocol
   implementation.

2.  Structure

   Trust within the delegation structure is solely based on public key
   signatures.  Namespace authorities must sign any mapping additions,
   modifications, delegations, and revocations as proof to the other
   consensus participants that such changes are legitimate.  For the
   sake of completeness, the public key and signature types are detailed
   below.  All types in this draft are described in XDR [RFC4506].

    typedef publickey opaque<>; /* Typically a 256 byte RSA signature */

    struct signature {
        publickey pk;
        opaque data<>;
    };

2.1.  Cells

   Cells are the basic unit of the delegation tree.  In general, they
   define an authenticated mapping record that may be queried by
   clients.  We describe two types of cells:



Li, et al.              Expires December 28, 2018               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             Delegated Mappings                  June 2018


       enum celltype {
           VALUE = 0,
           DELEGATE = 1
       };

   Value cells store individual mapping entries.  They resolve a lookup
   key to an arbitrary value, for example, an encryption key associated
   with an email address or a the address of an authoritative nameserver
   for a given DNS zone.  The public key of the cell's owner (e.g. the
   email account holder, the zone manager, etc.) is also included, as
   well as a signature authenticating the current version of the cell.
   The cell must be signed either by the "owner_key", or in some cases,
   the authority of the table containing the cell, as is described
   below.  The cell owner may rotate their public key at any time by
   signing the transition with the old key.

       struct valuecell {
           opaque value<>;
           publickey owner_key;
           signature transition_sig; /* Owner or table authority */
       };

   Delegate cells have a similar structure but different semantics.
   Rather than resolving an individual mapping, they authorize the
   delegee to create arbitrary value cells within an assigned namespace.
   This namespace must be a subset of the _delegator_'s own namespace
   range.  The delegee is identified by their public key.  Finally, each
   delegate cell and subsequent updates to the cell are signed by the
   delegator - this ensures that the delegee cannot unilaterally modify
   its namespace, which limits the range of mappings they can
   legitimately create.

       struct delegatecell {
           opaque namespace<>;
           publickey delegee;
           signature authority_sig;  /* Delegator only */
       };

   Both cell types share a set of common data members, namely a set of
   UNIX timestamps recording the creation time and, if applicable, the
   time of last modification.  They are useful indicators and will
   likely be useful in updating consensus nodes that have fallen behind.

   An additional "commitment" timestamp must be present in every
   mapping.  It is an explicit guarantee on behalf of the authority
   creating the cell that the mapping will remain valid until at least
   the specified time.  Therefore, while value cell owners may modify
   their cell at any moment, the authority cannot successfully change

   (or remove) the cell until its commitment expires.  Similarly,
   delegated namespaces are guaranteed to be valid until the commitment
   timestamp.  This creates a tradeoff between protecting delegees from
   arbitrary delegator action and allowing simple reconfiguration that
   can be customized for the use case.

       union innercell switch (celltype type) {
       case VALUE:
           valuecell vcell;
       case DELEGATE:
           delegatecell dcell;
       };

       struct cell {
           unsigned hyper create_time;     /* 64-bit UNIX timestamps */
           unsigned hyper *revision_time;
           unsigned hyper commitment_time;
           innercell c;
       }

2.2.  Tables

   Every cell is stored in a table, which groups all the mappings
   created by a single authority public key for a specific namespace.
   Individual cells are referenced by an application-specific label in a
   lookup table.  Below, we allow for a single lookup key to reference a
   list of cells, for the sake of generality.  The combination of a
   lookup key and a referenced cell value forms an _authenticated
   mapping_.

       struct tableentry {
           opaque lookup_key<>;
           cell cells<>;
       }

   Delegating the whole or part of a namespace requires adding a new
   lookup key for the namespace in question and a matching delegate
   cell.  Each delegation must be validated in the context of the other
   table entries and the table itself.  For example, it should not be
   possible for the owner of a /8 IPv4 block to delegate the same /16
   block to two different delegees.  In addition to a collection of
   entries, each table incorporates a "type" that informs each
   participating node of the particular delegation rules to apply to
   table entries.

       struct table {
           tabletype type;
           tableentry entries<>;
       };

   While there exist more delegation mechanisms than we could reasonably
   discuss in this draft, we initially propose three general-purpose
   schemes that cover the majority of use cases:

       enum tabletype {
           PREFIX = 0,
           SUFFIX = 1,
           FLAT = 2
       };

   Prefix-based delegation, such as in an IP delegation use case,
   requires every table cell value to be prefixed by the table
   namespace, and no cell value can be a prefix of another cell value.
   Similar rules apply to suffix-based delegation.  In cases where
   arbitrary values may be mapped (e.g. account names for an email
   service provider), "flat" delegation rules are used.

2.3.  Root Key Listing

   Each delegation tree, one per namespace, is rooted by a public key
   stored in a flat root key listing.  Well-known application identifier
   strings denote the namespace which the control; the associated
   namespace root keys form the starting point for lookups.  We describe
   below how lookups can be accomplished on the delegation trees.

       struct rootentry {
           publickey namespace_root_key;
           string application_identifier<>;
           signature listing_sig;
       }

       struct rootlisting {
           rootentry roots<>;
       }

   A significant open question is how to properly administer entries in
   this listing, since a strong authority, such as a single root key,
   can easily protect the listing from spam and malicious changes, but
   raises important concerns about censorship resilience and potential
   compromise.  A federated approach to management is more in line with
   the spirit of this draft but opens the door for counter-productive
   participation.  In the "rootentry" description above, we allow for
   either a root signing key to authenticate mappings, or first-come-

   first-served self-signed entries.  In either case, no more than one
   key may control the namespace for a specific application identifier.

2.4.  Data Structure

   Delegation trees are stored in a Merkle hash tree, described in
   detail in [RFC6962].  In particular, it enables efficient lookups and
   logarithmic proofs of existence in the tree, and prevents
   equivocation between different participants.  Specifically, we can
   leverage Google's [Trillian] Merkle tree implementation - on top of
   which Certificate Transparency is built - in map mode, which manages
   arbitrary key-value pairs at scale.  This requires flattening the
   delegation trees such that each table may be looked up, while
   ensuring that a full lookup from the application root be made for
   each mapping.  Given a "rootentry", the corresponding table in the
   Merkle tree can be found with this concatenation:

    root_table_name = app_id || namespace_root_key

   Similarly, tables for delegated namespaces are found at:

    root_table_name || delegee_key_1 || ... || delegee_key_n

   Consensus is performed on the Merkle tree containing the flattened
   collection of tables.

3.  Consensus

   Safety is ensured by reaching distributed consensus on the state of
   the tree.  The general nature of a Merkle tree as discussed in the
   previous section enables almost any consensus protocol to support
   delegated mappings, with varying guarantees on the conditions under
   which safety is maintained and different trust implications.  For
   example, a deployment on a cluster of nodes running a classic
   Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol such as [PBFT] requires a
   limited, static membership and can tolerate compromises in up to a
   third of its nodes.  In comparison, proof-of-work schemes including
   many cryptocurrencies have open membership but rely on economic
   incentives and distributed control of hashing power to provide
   safety, and federated consensus algorithms ([I-D.mazieres-dinrg-scp])
   combine dynamic members with real-world trust relationships but
   require careful configuration.  Determining which scheme, if any, is
   the "correct" protocol to support authenticated delegation is an open
   question.

3.1.  Validation

   Incorrect (potentially malicious) updates to the Merkle tree should
   be rejected by nodes participating in consensus.  Given the limited
   set of delegation schemes presented in the previous section, each
   node can apply the same validation procedure without requiring
   application-specific knowledge.  Upon any modification to the tree -
   addition of a new root entry, table or cell, or modification of an
   existing cell - the submitted change to the consensus layer should
   contain:

   (1) the updated or newly-created table, and

   (2) a Merkle proof containing all the hashes necessary to validate
   the new root tree hash.

   Finally, each node participating in consensus must confirm before
   voting for the update that:

   (1) the Merkle proof is correct, and

   (2a) an addition to the root key listing is correctly signed by an
   authorized party, or

   (2b) a new delegation is correctly authenticated, consists of a valid
   namespace value owned by the delegator, follows the table-specific
   delegation rules, and creates an empty table at the correct key in
   the tree, or

   (2c) a new value cell is correctly authenticated and belongs to the
   signing authority's namespace, and has no conflicts in its table, or

   (2d) a cell update is properly authenticated and, if proposed by the
   table authority, has an expired commitment timestamp.

   Only after a round of the consensus protocol is successful are the
   changes exposed to client lookups.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security of the delegation trees is primarily tied to the safety
   properties of the underlying consensus layer.  Further, incorrect use
   of the public key infrastructure authenticating each mapping or
   compromise of a namespace root key can endanger mappings delegated by
   the key after their commitments expire.
