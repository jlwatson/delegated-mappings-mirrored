1.  Introduction

   Internet applications rely heavily on authoritative translation to
   function correctly.  Typical services might resolve domain mappings
   using DNS [RFC1034], verify the validity of X.509 certificates
   [RFC6960], or send encrypted email [RFC4880], among others.  Serving
   incorrect and/or malicious mappings can easily compromise
   infrastructure security, thus prompting efforts to secure these
   mechanisms: Certificate Transparency (CT) [RFC6962] for misissued
   certificates, DNSSEC [RFC4033], and binary transparency for
   verifiable executables [bin-transparency].

   Presented in this draft is a generalized mechanism for authenticating
   and managing such mappings.  Specifically, we describe the structure
   for a distributed directory with explicit support for delegation.
   Certain known entities are assigned namespaces, loosely associated
   with a service provided by that entity (i.e domain prefixes for DNS
   Authorities).  Under that namespace, are authorized to create mapping
   records, or _cells_, a unit of ownership in the service.  A
   namespace's cells are grouped into a logical unit we term a _table_.

   Table cells may also explicitly document the delegation of a portion
   of the authority's namespace to another entity with a given public
   key, along with a guarantee on that delegation's lifetime.  Each
   delegation forms a new table, for which the delegee is the sole
   authority.  Thus, the delegating entity may not make modifications to
   a delegated table and need not be trusted by the delegee.  The
   namespace segment may be further delegated to others.

   The directory maintains security and consistency through a
   distributed consensus algorithm.  When a participant receives an
   update, they verify and submit it to the consensus layer, after
   which, if successful, the change is applied to its associated table.
   Clients may query any number of trusted servers and expect the result
   to be correct barring widespread collusion.

   The risk of successful attacks on this system vary based on the
   consensus scheme used.  Detailed descriptions of specific protocol
   implementations are out of scope for this draft, but at a minimum,
   the consensus algorithm must apply mapping updates in a consistent
   order, prevent equivocation or unauthorized modification, and enforce
   the semantic rules associated with each table.  We find that
   federated protocols such as the Stellar Consensus Protocol
   [I-D.mazieres-dinrg-scp] are promising given their capability for
   open participation, broad diversity of interests among consensus
   participants, and a measure of accountability for submitting
   deceptive updates.

   This document specifies the structure of the delgated mapping
   directory and its interface with a consensus protocol implementation.

2.  Structure

   TODO explain how owners/delegators/authorities are identified by
   their public key each authority can make delegations in their
   _table_, recorded in individual _cells_.

   explain use of signature briefly

   typedef publickey opaque<>; /* recommend 32 bytes? */

   struct signature {
       publickey pk;    /* */
       opaque data<>; /* recommend 256 bytes? */
   };

   /* */
   struct valuecell {
       opaque value<>;           /* */
       publickey owner_key;      /* */
       signature transition_sig; /* */
   };

   /* */
   struct delegatecell {
       opaque namespace<>;       /* */
       publickey *delegee;       /* */
       signature authority_sig;  /* */
   };

   enum celltype {
       VALUE = 0,
       DELEGATE = 1
   };

   /* */
   union cell switch (celltype type) {
   case VALUE:
       valuecell vcell;
   case DELEGATE:
       delegatecell dcell;
   };

2.2.  Tables

   /* */
   enum tabletype {
       PREFIX = 0,
       SUFFIX = 1,
       FLAT = 2
   };

   /* */
   struct tableentry {
       opaque lookup_key<>; /* */
       cell cells<>;        /* */
   }

   /* */
   struct table {
       tabletype type;        /* */
       tableentry entries<>; /* */
   };

2.3.  Root Key Listing

   /* */
   struct tableentry {
       publickey authority; /* */
       table *delegations;  /* */
   }

   /* */
   struct tables {
       tableentry entries<>; /* */
   }

   Adding to the root listing is by ???. No one knows yet.

2.4.  Delegation

   rules are based on the type of the table, discussed later (below).
   delegating the whole or part of a namespace requires adding a new
   lookup key for the namespace and a matching delegate cell.  The dcell
   should be created with the same namespace value, the publickey of the
   _delegee_, who will control a table for futher sub-delegating the
   namespace.  Finally, the dcell is signed by the table authority
   publickey to authorize the addition.

2.5.  Merkle Tree

   We can use the Trillian implementation _if_ we can uniquely identify
   tables by name -> root key + path of keys down to the delegation.
   Thus, to get to a table, you have to perform a log-time lookup
   procedure during which it is impossible to reach an entry not on the
   proper chain (hashes of a key chain should be hard to guess).  Also
   helps us validate delegation during consensus (discussed later) Thus,
   the virtual structure (tree of tables) is different from the actual
   structure (leaf-only Merkle tree).

   On delegation, the change should contain (1) proof (i.e. hash path to
   root for updated table), (2) the updated table delta, (3) the new
   table (empty) to add to the tree with the right key.

   Then: * explain how to hash up the tree / get an existence proof *
   what do we need to perform consensus? an added/updated cell and the
   hash path to the root
